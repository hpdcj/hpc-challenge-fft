   74.      *
   75.      * HPL_all_reduce performs   a   global   reduce  operation  across  all
   76.      * processes of a group leaving the results on all processes.
   77.      *
   78.      * Arguments
   79.      * =========
   80.      *
   81.      * BUFFER  (local input/global output)   void *
   82.      *         On entry,  BUFFER  points to  the  buffer to be combined.  On
   83.      *         exit, this array contains the combined data and  is identical
   84.      *         on all processes in the group.
   85.      *
   86.      * COUNT   (global input)                const int
   87.      *         On entry,  COUNT  indicates the number of entries in  BUFFER.
   88.      *         COUNT must be at least zero.
   89.      *
   90.      * DTYPE   (global input)                const HPL_T_TYPE
   91.      *         On entry,  DTYPE  specifies the type of the buffers operands.
   92.      *
   93.      * OP      (global input)                const HPL_T_OP 
   94.      *         On entry, OP is a pointer to the local combine function.
   95.      *
   96.      * COMM    (global/local input)          MPI_Comm
   97.      *         The MPI communicator identifying the process collection.
