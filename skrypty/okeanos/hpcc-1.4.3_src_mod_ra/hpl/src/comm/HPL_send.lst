   83.     * to  allow for some  experimentation / tuning  of this simple routine.
   84.     * Successful  completion  is  indicated  by  the  returned  error  code

   86.     * zero, this function returns immediately.

   91.     * SBUF    (local input)                 double *

   95.     * SCOUNT  (local input)                 int
   96.     *         On entry,  SCOUNT  specifies  the number of  double precision
   97.     *         entries in SBUF. SCOUNT must be at least zero.
   98.     *
   99.     * DEST    (local input)                 int
  100.     *         On entry, DEST specifies the rank of the receiving process in
  101.     *         the communication space defined by COMM.
  102.     *
  103.     * STAG    (local input)                 int
  104.     *         On entry,  STAG specifies the message tag to be used for this
  105.     *         communication operation.

  107.     * COMM    (local input)                 MPI_Comm
