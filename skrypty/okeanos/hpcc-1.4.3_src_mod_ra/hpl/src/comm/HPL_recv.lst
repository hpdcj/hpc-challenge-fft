   82.     * HPL_recv is a simple wrapper around  MPI_Recv.  Its  main  purpose is
   83.     * to  allow for some  experimentation / tuning  of this simple routine.
   84.     * Successful  completion  is  indicated  by  the  returned  error  code
   85.     * HPL_SUCCESS.  In the case of messages of length less than or equal to
   86.     * zero, this function returns immediately.

   89.     * =========

   91.     * RBUF    (local output)                double *
   92.     *         On entry, RBUF specifies the starting address of buffer to be
   93.     *         received.

   95.     * RCOUNT  (local input)                 int
   96.     *         On entry,  RCOUNT  specifies  the number  of double precision
   97.     *         entries in RBUF. RCOUNT must be at least zero.
   98.     *
   99.     * SRC     (local input)                 int
  100.     *         On entry, SRC  specifies the rank of the  sending  process in
  101.     *         the communication space defined by COMM.
  102.     *
  103.     * RTAG    (local input)                 int
  104.     *         On entry,  STAG specifies the message tag to be used for this
  105.     *         communication operation.

  107.     * COMM    (local input)                 MPI_Comm
  108.     *         The MPI communicator identifying the communication space.
