   69.      * HPL_pdlamch determines  machine-specific  arithmetic  constants  such  as
   70.      * the relative machine precision (eps),  the safe minimum(sfmin) such that
   71.      * 1/sfmin does not overflow, the base of the machine (base), the precision
   72.      * (prec),  the  number  of  (base)  digits in the  mantissa  (t),  whether
   73.      * rounding occurs in addition (rnd = 1.0 and 0.0 otherwise),  the  minimum
   74.      * exponent before  (gradual)  underflow (emin),  the  underflow  threshold
   75.      * (rmin)- base**(emin-1), the largest exponent before overflow (emax), the
   76.      * overflow threshold (rmax)  - (base**emax)*(1-eps).
