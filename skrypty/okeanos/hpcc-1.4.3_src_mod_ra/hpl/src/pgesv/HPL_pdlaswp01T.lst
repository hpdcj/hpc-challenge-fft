   71.      * =======
   72.      *
   73.      * HPL_pdlaswp01T applies the  NB  row interchanges to  NN columns of the
   74.      * trailing submatrix and broadcast a column panel.
   75.      *  
   76.      * A "Spread then roll" algorithm performs  the swap :: broadcast  of the
   77.      * row panel U at once,  resulting in a minimal communication volume  and
   78.      * a "very good"  use of the connectivity if available.  With  P  process
   79.      * rows  and  assuming  bi-directional links,  the  running time  of this
   80.      * function can be approximated by:
   81.      *  
   82.      *    (log_2(P)+(P-1)) * lat +   K * NB * LocQ(N) / bdwth
   83.      *  
   84.      * where  NB  is the number of rows of the row panel U,  N is the global
   85.      * number of columns being updated,  lat and bdwth  are the latency  and
   86.      * bandwidth  of  the  network  for  double  precision real words.  K is
   87.      * a constant in (2,3] that depends on the achieved bandwidth  during  a
   88.      * simultaneous  message exchange  between two processes.  An  empirical
   89.      * optimistic value of K is typically 2.4.
   90.      *

   93.      *
   94.      * PBCST   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel *
   95.      *         On entry,  PBCST  points to the data structure containing the
   96.      *         panel (to be broadcast) information.
   97.      *
   98.      * IFLAG   (local input/output)          int *
   99.      *         On entry, IFLAG  indicates  whether or not  the broadcast has
  100.      *         already been completed.  If not,  probing will occur, and the
  101.      *         outcome will be contained in IFLAG on exit.

  103.      * PANEL   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel *
  104.      *         On entry,  PANEL  points to the data structure containing the

  107.      * NN      (local input)                 const int
  108.      *         On entry, NN specifies  the  local  number  of columns of the
  109.      *         trailing  submatrix  to  be swapped and broadcast starting at
  110.      *         the current position. NN must be at least zero.
