   69.      * =======

   71.      * HPL_pdgesv factors a N+1-by-N matrix using LU factorization with row
   72.      * partial pivoting.  The main algorithm  is the "right looking" variant
   73.      * with  or  without look-ahead.  The  lower  triangular  factor is left
   74.      * unpivoted and the pivots are not returned. The right hand side is the
   75.      * N+1 column of the coefficient matrix.
