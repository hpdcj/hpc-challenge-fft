   71.     * HPL_ladd adds  without carry two long positive integers  K and J and
   72.     * puts the result into I. The long integers  I, J, K are encoded on 64
   73.     * bits using an array of 2 integers.  The 32-lower bits  are stored in
   74.     * the  first  entry  of each array,  the 32-higher bits  in the second
   75.     * entry.

   80.     * J       (local input)                 int *
   81.     *         On entry, J is an integer array of dimension 2 containing the
   82.     *         encoded long integer J.
   83.     *
   84.     * K       (local input)                 int *
   85.     *         On entry, K is an integer array of dimension 2 containing the
   86.     *         encoded long integer K.

   88.     * I       (local output)                int *
